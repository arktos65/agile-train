# Scrum Agile Processes

Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development methodology for managing product development. It 
defines "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common 
goal", challenges assumptions of the "traditional, sequential approach" to product development, and enables teams to
self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily 
face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project.

A key principle of scrum is its recognition that during production processes, the customers can change their minds 
about what they want and need (often called "requirements churn"), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily 
addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting 
that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver 
quickly, to respond to emerging requirements and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.

Scrum is not only a concrete set of practices – rather, and more importantly, it is a framework that provides 
transparency, and a mechanism that allows “inspect and adapt”. Scrum works by making visible the dysfunction and 
impediments that are impacting the Product Owner and the Team’s effectiveness, so that they can be addressed.

## Key Roles

* **Product Manager** - identifies market opportunities, develops product requirements, feature lists, and responsible for implementation of the product.
* **Product Owner** - identifies product features, translating these into a prioritized list, deciding which should be at
the top of the list for the next Sprint.  Continually re-prioritizes and refines the feature list.
* **Development Team** - build the product that the Product Owner indicates.  The Development Team is "cross-functional" --
that includes all the expertise necessary to deliver the potentially shippable product each Sprint.  The team is
self organizing with a high degree of autonomy and accountability.  Developers are responsible for working on and updating
tickets.
* **ScrumMaster** - helps the product group learn and apply Scrum to achieve business value.  The ScrumMaster facilitates
and organizes, but _does not_ manage the team.

## Key Terms

* **Product Backlog** - a list of customer-centric features.  The Product Backlog exists and evolves over the lifetime
of the product; it is a roadmap.  It is a single definitive view of everything that could be done by the Team ever,
in priority order.  The Product Owner organizes the Product Backlog.
* **Definition of Done** - The output of every Sprint is officially called a Potentially Shippable Product Increment.
In order to better understand when a feature is shippable, the Definition of Done is created to describe what conditions
must be met beore a feature is considered Done and ready to ship.
* **Sprint Planning** - A meeting to prepare for a Sprint.
* **Backlog Grooming** - A meeting to review the Product Backlog and decompose issues into workable tasks, in advance
of selecting the issues for a Sprint.
* **Sprint** - A formal time period where the Development Team selects a number of issues from the Product Backlog
and commits to completing the tasks.
* **Daily Scrum** - AKA The Stand Up - Brief daily meeting for team updates and coordination.
* **Sprint Review** - A meeting that occurs at the end of the sprint where Development Team presents their work to
all the stakeholders.
* **Retrospective** - A meeting that typically occurs after the Sprint Review for the Development Team to discuss
how the sprint worked and address any issues that arose, leading to refinements or changes to improve velocity and
quality of the product.
