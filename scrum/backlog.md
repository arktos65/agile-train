# Backlog Policies

The product backlog is a list of issues and tasks the be decomposed, estimated, and scheduled.  Product
Owners are responsible for priotizing their respective backlogs.  Every two weeks, Engineering will
review the backlog, decompose new tickets, and provide estimates for stories.

While the Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing the backlog into an order, Engineering 
selects the workload commitment each sprint.  The Product Owner advises the development team
on product priorities and user requirements.  The development team decides on implementation
and technical dependencies within the bounds of established systems architecture and
technologies approved for use in the Company.

## What Goes in the Backlog?

The product backlog is basically a list of `items` that comprise user stories, use cases, engineering
improvements, bug reports, and other tasks that represent an effort to provider **adds value** for the product
users.

Backlog items are prioritized by the Product Owner.  The development team works to study, refine, and 
clarify backlog items per the Definition of Ready.  

## Definition of Ready

Before a story or task is ready to be selected for a sprint, it must meet the following criteria, known as the
Definition of Ready:

* Appropriately sized stories - DEVELOPMENT TEAM
* Has acceptance criteria - PRODUCT OWNER
* How to demo is understood (if appropriate) - DEVELOPMENT TEAM/PRODUCT OWNER
* What are the data sources? - DEVELOPMENT TEAM
* What are the tests? - DEVELOPMENT TEAM
* Style? - PRODUCT OWNER
* Design
    * Has layout & colors - PRODUCT OWNER/DEVELOPMENT TEAM
    * Expected functionality defined - PRODUCT OWNER/DEVELOPMENT TEAM
    
If an issue is not well defined, it should not be selected by the Development Team for a sprint.

## Estimation and Decomposition

During the bi-weekly backlog grooming meeting, the Development Team and Product Owner review the
unestimated issues and tasks in the product backlog.  During this process the goal is to reach the
Definition of Ready for each issue.  

It is the responsibility of the Product Owner to ensure sufficient information has been provided
to the Development Team to define the issue and prepare it for scheduling.

It is the responsibility of the Development Team to ensure that the issue has been understood, tasks and
tests identified, and sized correctly.

Pulselocker uses Jira to manage the backlog and sprints.  There are three different types of items
that can be added to the backlog: stories, bugs, and tasks.

### Stories

Stories are backlog items that require estimation of effort measure in points.  A story **does not**
have to be a user story.  It can be a user story, a use case, an engineering improvement, or anything
that requires effort by the Development Team that adds value to the product for users.

### Bugs

Bugs are reports of features that are not operating as designed.  Sometimes there is confusion as to
what constitutes a bug versus a story.  If the feature does not behave as it was designed or is 
simply broken -- this constitutes a bug.  If Product Owner wants to change the behavior of a
feature -- this is a story.

### Tasks

Tasks are items that **do not directly add value** to a product.  An example of a task is a Spike: an 
item that describes research that needs to be done investigating new technologies, techniques, or
solutions supporting stories that will be worked on at a future date.  

## Sprint Commitment

At the beginning of a sprint, the Development Team and Product Owner meet to plan the sprint.  In order
for an issue to be considered for inclusion in the sprint it must be:

* Properly prioritized
* Meets the Definition of Ready

Once the sprint has started, the commitment is firm and should not be altered.  This means that issues 
forgotten or attempts to change priorities mid-sprint.  Such changes indict insufficient planning and
must be addressed in the grooming and planning meetings.  

All sprint commitment changes **must** be approved by the VP, Engineering.  There are no exceptions.
**A Product Owner does not have the authority to change the scope of a ticket after it has been
accepted by the Development Team in a sprint.**

## When Things Go Wrong

It is an inevitability of life that things go wrong from time to time, this includes sprints.  Sometimes
information is missing or business priorities abruptly change. In the rare instances that this happens
it makes no sense for the Development Team to continue forward wasting valuable time and resources. In 
these situations, it is sometimes best to stop the sprint, work out the issues and start a new 
sprint. 

Who can stop a sprint?  Either the senior engineering manager or the Development Team.  The important
part is that the Development Team, if they reach consensus, has the right to stop the sprint and 
regroup to gain further clarity in purpose and goals.  This serves as a fail safe and by its nature
should be very disruptive.  Careful planning and analysis should prevent this from happening, but
at the same time it acknowledges that things happen that are sometimes beyond our control.
